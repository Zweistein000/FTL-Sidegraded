# FTL-Sidegraded
Stellaris FTL project

PURPOSE 

Purpose of this mod is to both rebalance FTL and make it more interesting mechanic. This mode is mean to be played with Hyperlane-only enabled so not all FTL are avaiable at game start. You will be able to research and reverse engineer all non-psionic FTL drives. Each of the FTL drives functions differently and will give you a specific advantage, as well as a disadvantage which keep the Hyperlane tech competitive. 

CHANGES
FTL was changed the following way:
- Hyperlane ramins mostly the same. Cooldown time is increased, while charge up time is reduced. The reasoning behid this is that Hyperdrives are only activated to breach the barrier between normal space and hyperspace. The hyperlanes themselves are empty and thus no special FTL plotting is needed. Due to the high speed of Hyperlane travel, the hyperdrive gets activated twice in quick succession which drains the energy reserves of the vessel requiring a recharge time upon arrival. There will be no additional charge-up time based on the distance from friendly territory. Hyperdive is already a very interesting drive as well as the best starting FTL as the hyper-lanes create an interesting topography of the galaxy, is decently fast, useful for both exploration and combat but it does come with its own set of drawbacks, mainly freedom of movement. 
- Warp is a rare-tech available after fusion has been researched. Warp speed will remian the same but it's cooldown and warm-up time are inverted and recuded. Going to warp takes more time than breaching the hyperlane space and the ship must both expend energy to bend spece-time as well as perform calculations in order to avoid a collisions with phyiscal objects as the vessel travels through normal space. Warp thus havs no cooldown, but a decently long spool-up time. This should buff the warp as an offensive-first strike drive but it should still lose in a race to Hyperlanes. The main advantage of warp is it's relative freedom to move about the galaxy, ignoring the topogaphy that was created with hyperdrive. As the warp vessels are required to sustain their own warp bubble for the duration of the warp flight the energy requirements of a warp drive are slighly higher than that of a Hyperdrive. Warp remains the best FTL drive for exploring the galaxy early and as such has a higher chance of appearing for materialists and even higher for fanatic materialists. 
- Wormhole drive is a mid-late game rare tech that fills the void between warp and hyperdrive, but comes with its own set of advantages and drawbacks. Because wormholes are generted with wormhole station the ships using this method of FTL require no onboard FTL drives freeing up energy for other subsystems. The wormhole stations themselves are expensive and require a higher energy upkeep in order to function compered to vanilla wormhole stations. They have a decent range in which they allow the ships to move about near instantaneously and freely but the ships cannot traverse outside the range limits of the stations. The wornhole drive  remains the best drive to use for hit-and-run skrimishes but offers a unique disadvantage in the form of wormhole station which, if destroyed will trap fleets behind enemy lines, as well as it's relatively short range which limits offensive action. Wormhole drives are very string defensively but are somewhat more challenging to fully utilise offensively. As such being pacifist, fanatic pacifist or inwards perfection (isolationist) increases the change of the tech appearing.
 - Jump drive remains almost untouched. Its main disadvantage remains its ability to trigger the Unbidden crisis, but otherwise reimains a drive with a short cooldown, decent spoolup and instant travel between jump locations. Jump drive did recieve two additional drawbacks, which are a high power consuption and high mineral cost. Phasing out of our dimension and poping back in requires large amounts of energy. This also means that if a crisis has already been triggered the jump drive still retains some of its disadvantages. 
- PSI jump drive is no longer jump drive MK2, but is rather a conterpart to the jump drive. As PSI jumping only requires the minds of powerful psionsic individuals the ships utilising PSI jump drives do not require conventional FTL drives. This advantage comes with the drawback of reduced range, increased spool-up and wind-down when compared to regular Jump drives as jumping an entire ship requires great concentration and is strenous for the people involved. 

CHANGELOG:

1.0.0.
Wormhole drive:
 - Now requires antimater energy to appear. It is considered a rare tech. 
 - Upgrade techs for wormhole range and speed removed. Wormhole drive always functions as if the first upgrade was researched (80 range, 1.5 fleet power to worm-hole generation time).
 - Wormhole station cost increased to 300 form 75, energy consumption increased to 1.00 form 0.25.
 - Chance of wormhole tech appearing is increased by 15% for pacifists, 25% for fanatic pacifist and 50% for inwards perfection
 - Wormhole tech has a higher chance of appearing if your scientist is a Curator, Maniacal, genious or is specialised in field manipulation.
 - Removed time penalty for generating wormholes outside your territory.
 
Hyperdrive:
 - Spool-up time reduced to 5 days from 15.
 - Cooldown increased to 10 days form 0. 
 - FTL travel speed increased to 2 per tick from 1 (to make it still better than warp).
 - Energy cost recuded to 2.5/5/7.5 for the respective level of hyperdrive.
 - Mineral cost increased to 5/10/15 for the respective level of hyperdrive. 
 - Removed spool-up penatly for hyperdriving outside your territory.
 - Upgrades reduce spool-up time by 20% and 40% respectivelly.
 - Upgrades reduce cooldown time by 25% and 50% respectivelly.

Warp:
 - Now requires fusion power to appear. It is considered a rare tech.
 - Warp drive has no cooldown time, but has a spool-up time that longer based on the distance between starting and target system. 
 - Spool-up time is 25% faster compared to cooldown time form vanilla Stellaris. 
 - Energy cost increased to 5/10/15 for the respective level of warp drive.
 - Mineral cost reduced to 2.5/5/7.5 for the respective level of warp drive.
 - Upgrades reduce spool-up time by 20% and 40% respectively. Warping long distances is no longer a major detriment in a war. 
 - Upgrades increases range by 40% and 80% repectivelly. 
 - Range of level 1 warp increased to 60 from 50. 
 - Removed cool-down penatly for warping outside your territory. 

Jump drive:
 - Costs 30 minerals and 30 energy from 15 minerals and 15 energy.

PSI Jump drive
 - Range reduced to 80% of jump drive range from 150% jump drive range.
 - Spool-up time increased by 20% compared to jump drive.
 - Cool-down time increased by 20% compared to jump drive
 - Costs 0 minerals and 0 energy. 

Other changes:
 - All FTL techs except PSI jump drive are reverse-engineerable. 
 - Replaced the english localization file to feature the description for Hyperdrive cooldown (I will look into injecting the text rahter than outright replacing the localization file).

OTHER NOTES:

Disclaimer: This mod has recieved limited testing. More feedback on the FTL balance is always appreciated. 
If you like the mod but feel like any of my changes are unfair, unfounded, silly or you genuinely don't like them leave me a comment. Also feel free to fork the mod and make your own changes. Link to steam workshop:
